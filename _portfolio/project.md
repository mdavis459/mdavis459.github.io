In this project, I researched the correlation between Poverty Rate and where each Baltimore City's schools are located. And then the following map, describes the relationship between school enrollment and Baltimore City's schools. Together, you can find two maps that shows if poverty rate and school enrollment have a relationship between each other. You can find the report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13sfphH_XbMIXwtUh64BaIAJz24LzrL7geNWBp5dr2Bc/view)
