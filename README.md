# Get to Know me
I am almost an alumni at University of Maryland Baltimore County majoring in Environmental Sciences and Geography

- Some certifications that I have recently gained are OSHA 10 Training for General Industry and I am in the works in finshing in my 40-hour Hazwoper Certification 
- As a student, I have learned that I fell into liking GIS. But as for my current job, I am a field staff scientist who collects soil samples and rock corings samples. Here is a link to my resume (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nsP4JWy5-Z6H0EtE3DlT_toHXp68IQ3Xy5A4w-UiPu4/view)
- Some projects that connect to my interests and experiences are the classwork that involve ArcGISPro and QGIS
